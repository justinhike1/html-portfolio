<h1>Justin Hike Web Development</h1>
<p>I'm Justin Hike and I'm a freelance Web Developer and Music Educator.</p>

<p>While my experience in web development is new, technology has always been a part of my life and a point of great interest. My father was a network administrator, so from a young age I was exposed to the incredible world of computers and the growth/development of the Internet. It is my hope that I can take what I have learned in web development and share my talents with everyone.</p>

<p>Beyond web development, I am a licensed music educator in the state of Texas. Originally from Iowa where I taught for 7 years, I moved to Texas in 2021 to be closer to family and challenge myself in the music education field. My experience as an educator has taught me tenacity, flexibility, and patience. I am confident I can take the many skills I have learned as an educator and apply them to my budding web development career.</p>
